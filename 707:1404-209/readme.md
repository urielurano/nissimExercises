This part was for 'fEpsilonCo'

The graph of the univariate spline i got it by the next param:
-The for of the function get the values (-1.0,3.0,0.250)
-The linspace of x_new hate the values (10e-2, 1000,10000)
-It was make the graph with univariate spline k = 2

The graph of the pchipplot way with the next param:
-The for of the function get the values (-1.0,3.0,0.2150)
-The linspace of x_new hate the values (10e-2, 60,500)

The graph of the rbfplot way with the next param:
-The for of the function get the values (-1.0,3.0,0.250)
-The linspace of x_new hate the values (10e-2, 20,100)
-I call Rfb with the function thin_plate
-No call smooth and epsilon param in the function
